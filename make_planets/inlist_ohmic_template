# v_avg: average velocity in the wind layer [cm s^-1]. Suggested: 1e3-1e4 cm/s
# lmin, lmax: minimum and maximum multipoles of the (vxB) term
# p_atm: Pressure considered for the wind layers [bar]. Suggested: 10-100 bar
# p_dyn: Pressure considered to evaluate the dynamo quantities [bar]. Suggested: 1e6 bar (the metallic H high conductivity region)
# scaling_b: Flag for scaling law: Reiners et al. 2009 'R', Christensen et al. 2009 'C'
# fohm:  Fraction of Ohmically dissipated power over the total, for magnetic field scaling laws. Suggested: 1
# fdip:  Dipolarity at the dynamo surface, used to infer the surface field. Suggested: 0.5
# t_ohm_on Age at which the Ohmic heat is turned on linearly (avoid early times) [yr]. Suggested: 1e6 yr 
# t_ohm_full: Age at which the Ohmic heat reaches its full value [yr]. Suggested: 1e7 yr
# f_avg: Fraction of age over which taking the time-average of the Ohmic terms, for stability purposes (0 for no averages in time). Suggested: 0.1
# w_age_max: Maximum weight of the current value of Ohmic heating to give in the averages (1 for no averages in time). Suggested: 0.5.
# pcmin: pressure at which the Ohmic heating is manually damped outward [bar]. Set values <= 0 for not having it. Suggested 0 or 1 bar.
# s0:    width in log(p[bar]) of the exponential damping of Ohmic heating at layers p<p_min. Suggested: 0.25
