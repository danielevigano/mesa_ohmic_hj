data_to_Daniele_Vigano/T_EC

File "T_EC_xyz.dat" contains temperature and electrical conductivity which is calculated for a fixed density xyz [g/cm3] with varying temperature of the plasma from 50 to 35000 K. Here, xyz is fixed density of the file. This is the data which we have reported in Fig. 3 our 2021 paper.

Columns are as follows:

| temperature [K] | electrical conductivity [S/m] |

data_to_Daniele_Vigano/fixed_rho_vary_temp_600K_6000K

Files "ID_Transport.dat.xyz" contain data in which ionization and transport is calculated for a fixed density xyz [g/cm3] with varying temperature of the plasma from 600 to 6000 K. Here, xyz is fixed density of the file. This data set I sent to Wieland for the magnetic induction calculations. I think it will also be useful to you.

Columns as follows:

| pressure [Pa] | density [g/cm3] | | temperature [K] | | ionization degree | | electrical conductivity [S/m] | thermal conductivity [W/Km]|
